## My essential application list
---

I create a list for myself to remember what's my essential application, and I want to share with you.

All of these application are everything that I use daily and/or essential for my device.
<br/>
<br/>
### 1. Browser
---
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - My first choice for browser, it support many addons especially adblockers, i'll make sure to share with you, my firefox setup soon.

[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) - I also use chromium, usually for discord and element(matrix.org) to voice chat with my friends while gaming, because I disable microphone access for my main browser.

[Min](https://minbrowser.org/) - TBH i'm not really sure why I install this browser in the first place, I only know that this browser has a clean and minimal design for browsing, but not enough powerful to be my main browser, so I just left it there and open it once in a while.
<br/>
<br/>

### 2. Work-related Apps
---
Because I code with flutter, it may be not generally useful for everyone, but here the list.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I mainly use my vscode for writing my application, it has tons of extension that useful for my productivity, and I'll share my vscode setup too, pretty soon.

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Pretty sure I only need these 2 for creating device simulator, essential sdk and else, and building for iOS, for android it can be created with command line.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Github](https://github.com/) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - For managing code versioning? I'm not really sure what to put here.

For terminal I use default mac terminal.

### 3. Miscellaneous
---
This is kinda not essential, but i'm helped by most of these apps!

[Project highrise](https://www.kasedogames.com/projecthighrise) - Only games on my mac, basically I only install steam because of this games, build a building and managing an office, apartements and hotels, I only play with easy mode though, but it's my favorite games!

[Appcleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - Basically it uninstall application on my machine and delete any residual files, it can free some storage for your machine too!

[Exif cleaner](https://exifcleaner.com/) - It will clear exif data from photos, just put your photo or batch many photo and then the app will clear these exif and put back your photo back where it camefrom.

[Aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) - A download manager in terminal, it looks cool though! I use this application mainly for download torrent or super-mega-big-fat files, but recently I try with [Motrix](https://motrix.app/) it has gui, and not much features, simple.

[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) - My go-to vpn application for laptop and smartphone, it has flat subscription 5 EUR/USD per month.

[Affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) - Im not designer and im not good with picture, but this is my go-to application for editing image, and creating CV or resume.

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - My main vide player, I don't really play music on my machine locally, so it's basically only play my video.

[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) - Though I have to disable my macbook encryption, this is still my go-to encryption apps, I usually create encryption folder for my flashdrive, backup and even before I upload anything on cloud.
